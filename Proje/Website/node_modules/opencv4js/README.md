## Description
This is the official OpenCV.js file packaged into a npm package for ease of use.

<br>

## Why OpenCV-js?

This package is updated whenever a new OpenCV version is released officially. By using the package in your OpenCV based Node.js project, you don't need to manually place the opencv.js file or worry about keeping it up to date later.

`npm install` will automatically fetch the updates just like any other package.

## Usage

The usage will be similar to the official <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/de6/tutorial_js_nodejs.html">docs</a>.
